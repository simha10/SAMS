# New Features Implementation for SAMS

This document summarizes the new features implemented for the Geo-Fence Attendance Management System (SAMS) while maintaining full backward compatibility.

## 1. Multi-Branch Attendance ✅ COMPLETED

### Branch Model
- Created new `Branch` model with fields:
  - `name`: Branch name
  - `location`: Object with `lat` and `lng` coordinates
  - `radius`: Geofence radius (default 50m)
  - `isActive`: Boolean flag for active status
  - `timestamps`: Created/updated timestamps

### Attendance Model Updates
- Added `branch` field referencing Branch model
- Added `distanceFromBranch` field to store distance in meters

### User Model Updates
- Added `dob` field for date of birth
- Added index on `dob` field for efficient birthday queries

### Attendance Logic Updates
- Employees can check in from ANY branch (not restricted to a single assigned branch)
- During check-in, system finds nearest valid branch within defined radius
- If outside all branch geofences, attendance is flagged with distance information
- Updated time rules:
  - Full attendance marking allowed anytime between 12:01 AM and 11:59 PM
  - Half-day threshold changed from 4 hours → 5 hours
  - Attendance marked between 9 AM to 7 PM is always clean (not flagged) unless it's holiday/Sunday

## 2. Holiday Rules ✅ COMPLETED

### Holiday Model Updates
- Added `isRecurringSunday` field (default false)
- All Sundays are automatically treated as holidays
- If employee marks attendance on Sunday → always flagged
- Managers can declare monthly holidays via API/UI

## 3. Birthday Notification Feature ✅ COMPLETED

### User Model Updates
- Added `dob` field as Date (indexed for performance)

### Birthday Cron Job
- Created daily cron job at 8:00 AM
- Scans for employees whose month & day match today
- Notifies all employees (not just managers)
- Notification format: "🎉 Hey team, today is <Employee_Name>’s birthday! Make sure to contribute for the celebration 🥳🎂"

### Frontend Updates
- Added birthday banner in dashboard using Zustand global store
- Banner can be dismissed by user

## 4. Flagged Attendance Enhancements ✅ COMPLETED

### Enhanced Flagging
- If attendance is flagged due to location breach, store:
  - `flaggedReason`: "Outside geofence - 128.4 meters away from nearest office branch"
- Include `distanceFromBranch` in CSV/Excel reports and manager dashboard

## 5. Detailed Reporting ✅ COMPLETED

### New Detailed Attendance Reports
- Created detailed attendance reports including:
  - Branch information
  - Distance from branch
  - Check-in/check-out locations
  - Enhanced formatting for flagged records
- Available in both CSV and Excel formats

## 6. Enhanced Dashboard UI ✅ COMPLETED

### Unified Header Layout
- Implemented consistent header layout for Manager/Director dashboards
- Added proper spacing and alignment for all screen sizes
- Improved user information display with text truncation for long names
- Enhanced mobile responsiveness with appropriate padding and margins

### Role-Specific Page Titles
- Removed generic dashboard title from header layout
- Added role-specific titles on individual pages (Team Attendance, Leave Approvals, etc.)
- Maintained consistent styling across all dashboard pages

### Responsive Design Improvements
- Fixed header alignment issues on mobile devices
- Improved spacing between elements for better readability
- Enhanced touch targets for mobile usability
- Optimized layout for different screen sizes

## 7. Testing ✅ COMPLETED

### Jest Test Suites Created
- `branch.test.js`: Branch model validation
- `userExtended.test.js`: User model with dob field
- `attendanceExtended.test.js`: Attendance model with branch references
- `holidayExtended.test.js`: Holiday model with isRecurringSunday field
- `multiBranchAttendance.test.js`: Multi-branch support validation
- `workingHoursRule.test.js`: Half-day/Full-day (5-hour rule) validation
- `birthdayNotification.test.js`: Birthday notification features
- `holidayRules.test.js`: Sunday + manager-declared holiday restrictions

## 8. API Endpoints ✅ COMPLETED

### New Branch Endpoints
- `GET /api/branches` - Get all active branches
- `POST /api/branches` - Create new branch (director only)
- `PUT /api/branches/:id` - Update branch (director only)
- `DELETE /api/branches/:id` - Delete branch (director only)

### Updated Holiday Endpoints
- Enhanced holiday creation/update to support `isRecurringSunday` field

### New Report Endpoints
- `POST /api/reports/attendance/detailed` - Generate detailed attendance reports

### Enhanced Dashboard Endpoints
- `GET /api/manager/dashboard/stats` - Get dashboard statistics for manager/director
- `GET /api/manager/team/members` - Get team members with enhanced profile data

## 9. Backward Compatibility ✅ MAINTAINED

All new features maintain full backward compatibility:
- Existing attendance logic preserved except where specified
- Cron jobs, notifications, holiday system, leave module, manager approval, role permissions unchanged
- All existing dashboard views and functionality preserved
- No unused code or placeholders added

## 10. Deployment ✅ READY

All features are compatible with:
- Render (backend) free tier
- Vercel (frontend) free tier
- MongoDB Atlas
- No code increases deployment cost
